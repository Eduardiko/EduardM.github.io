## THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUND IN VIDEOGAMES

Sound in videogames is one of the most important aspects of it due to the fact that it can hardly impact on the immersion of the players and very quickly. This is due to the amount of information that they convey:
 - Suggest a mood, evoke a feeling:
   - Sound has always been used to represent many kind of emotions and this is the most common use. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygA8AZXR7IA&ab_channel=Play4Games)

 - Indicate a geographical locale and the environment:
   - In videogames, a good sound design allows the player to know its location even though they are not seeing the game. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0ZFtb9RH-Q&t=2139s&ab_channel=SmallAnt)

 - Mirror or exaggerate how things sound in real life:
   - Although we may not think about the sounds we hear every day, we recognize them readily and have preconceptions about how things should sound. That's why we can get really quickly out of the immersion if we notice a sound that is just "off". [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JY4WHPVIiQ&ab_channel=MashableWatercooler)

## KINDS OF SOUNDS IN VIDEO GAMES

All the different sounds that appear in videogames are distributed in families, that I will now explain. Normally, all video games should include every single one of the families below. The only case in which one of these could be removed is when that is the idea of the game, it is done in purpose.

 - DX = Dialogue - any verbal speech in the game. This includes both the dialogues from main characters to the ones between NPC’s in the background.

 - MX = Music - all the different soundtracks that accompanies the videogame. We can distinguish between two kind of music: **diegetic** and **non-diegetic**. The difference between these two is that the non-diegetic music is that kind of music that the characters inside the game are not able to hear. We are the only ones that can.

 - SFX = Sound Effects - any sound that happens in the game. Examples could be gunshots, the sound of a book falling…
   - The most common technique used to create sounds is known as the **Foley Technique**. It is named after Jacl Foley and it consists in the reproduction of everyday sounds that are later on added in the post-production phase of videogames, films and others.

 - BG = Backgrounds - ambience sounds are all the background sounds which are present in a scene or location. Common ambient sounds include wind, water, birds, crowds, office noises, traffic...

## AUDIO BIBLE

Now that we have some clear understanding of the importance of sound in videogames and the different kinds of it we can start to think about developing the Audio Bible of our game. The Audio Bible is also commonly referred as the **Audio Design Document**. 
It is an extremely important document due to the fact that it gathers all the audio-related information of the game. Later on I will go deeply into the different parts that need to be taken into account when designing this document, and show a template as an example.
The Audio Bible is used throughout all the development process as a **reference** to the current team members and with possibly future ones. It helps the members to know how the sound is meant to be and the different rules and pillars that need to be followed during the development.

This document is always important but it is extremely useful when:
-	Multiple sound professionals are working (or could eventually work) on the same project.
-	You are working on multiple projects (so you can refer back to the document to refresh your memory and put yourself in the project’s mindset).
-	You’re working on a large project (it’s easy to drift off from the original project focus when you work on the same thing for a long time).

### WHAT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE WRITING THE AUDIO BIBLE

The are some steps before writing this document that are important to guarantee a good Audio Bible that will be used as the main reference as said before:
-	*Engage yourself with your team:*
    - Like many other things, **communication is key**. As said before, the audio of the game is so delicate and needs to be planned carefully. When working in a team, a good communication facilitates a lot things but apart from that it is crucial to keep in touch with people from other departments, like art directors, art leads, concept artists, level designers... Speaking to all the other teams helps to direct the audio to the desired outcome. The different scenarios, backgrounds and the how the action of levels will happen are some examples of things that inspire what will be the **audio vision** of the game.
-	*Define what the audio vision:*
    -	After we start getting a pretty good idea of what kind of game is it going to be we can start to decide **how all the different aspects of the game should or shouldn’t sound**. We can begin to get more meticulous about different qualities and how we would like them to sound. Although I said it is more meticulous, we are not currently deciding how things should exactly be, the audio vision helps to fit our idea of the audio in the “big picture” of the game. 
-	*Establish reference material:*
    -	Once we have in mind the audio vision of the game, it is good to gather information about projects with similar approaches to ours. It can help us get more inspired and possibly define better how we want things to be. Examples of references could be clips of sound-design, music, voice-over audios…
    -	When we have gathered up enough material, a good practice to get **inspired**, or on the other hand test our own elements is to take a piece/sound/voice-over of a scenario from our reference material and try it in one of our game. It can also be done the other way around, we take a piece of ours and try it on a scenario from another game similar to ours. This can give us information about our audio vision situation. It tells us if the direction we are focusing things is the right one.

### AUDIO BIBLE PARTS

Finally we have all the knowledge needed to start writing the final document that will be used throughout all the development. Now I will go deeply in every aspect that needs to be included in order to have a solid document:
- **Basic Information of the Game**
    - First of all and before getting into specifics, it is good to write down the basic information about the video game we are working on. Examples could be the genre of the game, its target audience, the game team and some of the games used for reference. Along with that information, a link to the **GDD (Game Design Document)** is needed so that team members can take deeper look of the overall project at any time.
-	**Audio Pillars**
    -	These are basically the same as the Game Pillars of the project, but actually focused on the audio.
    -	In three to five concepts they define the **overall aesthetic** of the different kind of sounds of the game.
    -	Audio Pillars are the most basic but important factors of the entire sound so every other aspect needs to take these into account.
-	**Music**
    -	*Style*: Is the most fundamental part of the music and it needs to match the overall feeling of the moment it is going to be used.
At this moment we don’t know exactly what kind of pieces we are going to make but we have an idea of what different styles will the game have.
    -	*Instrumentation*: A list of all the instruments that are going to be used to compose the music. They are going to be all real instruments? Will there be digital ones? Are we going to use both kinds at some point?
    -	*Recording/Engineering Philosophy*: here we have to write the methodology we are going to use to record all the audio of the instruments. Is it going to be all recorded at the same time in one track or are the different instruments going to be recorded separately into multiples tracks and later put together?
    -	*Dynamic Range*: this will set a range of how loud or quite can music get depending on the situation, establishing maximums and minimums. Also pieces are always going to sound at the same intensity or will it vary?
-	**Sound Effects**
    -	*Ambience*: a description of the different scenarios will help to understand what kind of ambience sound works better. This is a very important kind of sound, without ambience the game feels “empty”.
    -	*Sound Palette*: this is a list of all the possible sound effects that may be wanted during the development process. Here we need to think in every possible object or action that may cause a sound and list it. Main examples could be weapon sounds, item pickups, the player’s feedback, monsters, visual effects…
    -	*Dynamic Range*: just as before, sound effects also need to establish its dynamic range.
-	**Voice-Over**
    -	*Characters*: this is a list of all the characters that will need voice-over in the game. Here are separated the main characters, that are the ones that will need a personalized voice over, and the other ones like crowds or background characters. For the main characters, we will need to include their looks, personality, age, gender and profile.
    -	*Orientation*: it defines in a generic way the overall attitude of the characters voice-overs. For example are they going to have a more serious attitude or will they be more comedic or cartoonish. Is it going to be more focused on narrative or dialogues?
    -	*Voice Types Required*: taking into account the characters and the general orientation of the voice-over, what kind of voices are there going to be needed? A good way to know all required voice types is to grab the characters list previously done and match types of voices to them. An example could be a “Deep Voice” or a “High Pitch” one.
    -	*Cast Size*: once we know all the voice-types and to what character they correspond, it is time to decide the number of professional voice-overs needed. For that we will first need to write a list with the age range, the gender, the accent and any other relevant aspect that will be needed to be taken into account before starting to hire them.
    -	*Special Effect Voices*: this is a list of all the voices that will need some kind of effect on top of the normal ones. Some examples of that are when we need to have a robotic voice or one for a monster.
    -	*Script*: a document with the entire script and all the quotes that the actors will need to record.
-	**Technology**
    -	At this point we will have to take into account what kind of technology requirements will the game need. A part from that, we will also need to determine how we are going to get the audio into the game.
    -	*Technology*: 
         -	Number of platforms that need to be supported.
         -	The file formats like .ogg or .wav
         -	The data budget for the project. How much will all the audio weight? Is there a maximum or it can be unlimited?
