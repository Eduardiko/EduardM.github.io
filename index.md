## THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUND IN VIDEOGAMES

Sound in videogames is one of the most important aspects of it due to the fact that it can hardly impact on the immersion of the players and very quickly. This is due to the amount of information that they convey:
 - Suggest a mood, evoke a feeling:
   - Sound has always been used to represent many kind of emotions and this is the most common use. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygA8AZXR7IA&ab_channel=Play4Games)

 - Indicate a geographical locale and the environment:
   - In videogames, a good sound design allows the player to know its location even though they are not seeing the game. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0ZFtb9RH-Q&t=2139s&ab_channel=SmallAnt)

 - Mirror or exaggerate how things sound in real life:
   - Although we may not think about the sounds we hear every day, we recognize them readily and have preconceptions about how things should sound. That's why we can get really quickly out of the immersion if we notice a sound that is just "off". [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JY4WHPVIiQ&ab_channel=MashableWatercooler)

## KINDS OF SOUNDS IN VIDEO GAMES

All the different sounds that appear in videogames are distributed in families, that I will now explain. Normally, all video games should include every single one of the families below. The only case in which one of these could be removed is when that is the idea of the game, it is done in purpose.

 - DX = Dialogue - any verbal speech in the game. This includes both the dialogues from main characters to the ones between NPC’s in the background.
 - MX = Music - all the different soundtracks that accompanies the videogame. We can distinguish between two kind of music: **diegetic** and **non-diegetic**. The difference between these two is that the non-diegetic music is that kind of music that the characters inside the game are not able to hear. We are the only ones that can.
 - SFX = Sound Effects - any sound that happens in the game. Examples could be gunshots, the sound of a book falling…
   - The most common technique used to create sounds is known as the **Foley Technique**. It is named after Jacl Foley and it consists in the reproduction of everyday sounds that are later on added in the post-production phase of videogames, films and others. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=_MOFMa-Lt78&ab_channel=FoleyArt)
 - BG = Backgrounds - ambience sounds are all the background sounds which are present in a scene or location. Common ambient sounds include wind, water, birds, crowds, office noises, traffic...

## AUDIO BIBLE

Now that we have some clear understanding of the importance of sound in videogames and the different kinds of it we can start to think about developing the Audio Bible of our game. The Audio Bible is also commonly referred as the **Audio Design Document**. 
It is an extremely important document due to the fact that it gathers all the audio-related information of the game. Later on I will go deeply into the different parts that need to be taken into account when designing this document, and show a template as an example.
The Audio Bible is used throughout all the development process as a **reference** to the current team members and with possibly future ones. It helps the members to know how the sound is meant to be and the different rules and pillars that need to be followed during the development.

This document is always important but it is extremely useful when:
-	Multiple sound professionals are working (or could eventually work) on the same project.
-	You are working on multiple projects (so you can refer back to the document to refresh your memory and put yourself in the project’s mindset).
-	You’re working on a large project (it’s easy to drift off from the original project focus when you work on the same thing for a long time).

### What to Take Into Account Before Developing An Audio Bible

The are some steps before writing this document that are important to guarantee a good Audio Bible that will be used as the main reference as said before:
-	*Engage yourself with your team:*
  - Like many other things, communication is key. As said before, the audio of the game is so delicate and needs to be planned carefully. When working in a team, a good communication facilitates a lot things but apart from that it is crucial to keep in touch with people from other departments, like art directors, art leads, concept artists, level designers... Speaking to all the other teams helps to direct the audio to the desired outcome. The different scenarios, backgrounds and the how the action of levels will happen are some examples of things that inspire what will be the audio vision of the game.
-	*Define what the audio vision:*
  -	After we start getting a pretty good idea of what kind of game is it going to be we can start to decide how all the different aspects of the game should or shouldn’t sound. We can begin to get more meticulous about different qualities and how we would like them to sound. Although I said it is more meticulous, we are not currently deciding how things should exactly be, the audio vision helps to fit our idea of the audio in the “big picture” of the game. 
-	*Establish reference material:*
  -	Once we have in mind the audio vision of the game, it is good to gather information about projects with similar approaches to ours. It can help us get more inspired and possibly define better how we want things to be. Examples of references could be clips of sound-design, music, voice-over audios…
